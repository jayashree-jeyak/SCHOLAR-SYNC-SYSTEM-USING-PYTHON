# SCHOLAR-SYNC-SYSTEM-USING-PYTHON
Scholar Sync System is a smart university placement platform designed to automate and streamline the entire campus recruitment process. Developed using Python and modern web technologies, it connects students, recruiters, and placement coordinators through a unified, AI-powered interface.
Traditional placement processes often rely on manual data entry, static spreadsheets, and disconnected communication. This project addresses these issues by integrating machine learning for intelligent recommendations, cloud infrastructure for scalability, and an intuitive frontend for seamless interaction.

Key Features:
ML-Based Candidate Matching: Predicts suitable candidates based on academic records, skills, and preferences using Scikit-learn with ~85% accuracy.

Automated Interview Scheduling: Reduces coordinator workload by up to 70%.

Real-Time Notifications: Keeps students and recruiters informed about application status and interview updates.

Resume Management: Secure document upload and tracking.

Role-Based Access: Different dashboards for students, recruiters, and coordinators.

Cloud Hosting: Deployed on AWS for reliability and scale.

 Tech Stack:
Frontend: ReactJS

Backend: Django (Python)

ML Engine: Scikit-learn

Database: PostgreSQL

Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)

 Results:
Successfully tested using historical placement data.

Achieved high accuracy in job recommendations.

Over 90% positive feedback from student users.

 Future Scope:
Integration with blockchain for secure and tamper-proof records.

AI-powered video interview analysis for enhanced screening.

Support for multi-institution collaboration.

This system was developed as part of an academic project and presented at the 2025 International Conference on Circuit Power and Computing Technologies (ICCPCT).

 Built with scalability, transparency, and user experience in mind, Scholar Sync sets the foundation for the future of campus recruitment.
